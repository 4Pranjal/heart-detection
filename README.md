## About

This project demonstrates the process of using neural networks to predict heart disease based on medical features. It includes steps for loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, building neural network models, training, and evaluating model performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Cleveland Heart Disease dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/processed.cleveland.data) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains various medical attributes that are used to predict the presence of heart disease.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/4Pranjal/Heart-Disease-Detection.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Heart-Disease-Detection
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas numpy sklearn keras matplotlib tensorflow
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter Notebook `heart_detection.ipynb` using Jupyter or JupyterLab.

2. Follow the step-by-step explanations in the notebook to understand the data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

## Results

The project provides insights into the performance of both categorical and binary neural network models for heart disease prediction. The classification reports and accuracy metrics are included in the notebook for evaluation.
